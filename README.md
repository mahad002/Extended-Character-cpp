# Extended-Character-cpp

Implementation of Extended Character – Your goal is to implement “ExtendedCharacter" class. Primitive data
type to store character needs 1 Byte ranging from (0000 0000 TO 1111 1111). Your goal it to implement character
class that will able to store characters in their binary form as strings (0000000000000000 TO 1111111111111111).
Each instance will be stored in binary representation e.g. ‘A’ will be stored as “0000000001000001”. You will need to
write three files (ExtendedCharacter.h, ExtendedCharacter.cpp and Q1.cpp). Your implemented class must fully
provide the definitions of following class (interface) functions. Please also write down the test code to drive your class
implementation. Please note that we will be running your code against our test code and any segmentation faults or
incorrect result will result in loss of marks.
